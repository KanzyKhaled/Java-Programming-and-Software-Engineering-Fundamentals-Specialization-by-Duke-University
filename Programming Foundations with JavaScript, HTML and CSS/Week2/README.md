# WEEK 2 NOTES

###  Write a JavaScript program that modifies images

#### A Seven Step Approach to Solving Programming Problems
1) The first thing to do is to solve a small instance by hand.
2) In step 2, you're going to write down the exact steps of what you did in step 1.
3) In step 3, we need to find patterns.
4) Once we finish step 3, we want to check our algorithm by hand.
5) Once we're confident in our algorithm, we're ready to translate it into code.
6) Once we've written this down, we want to run test cases.
7) Move on to step 7, debugging failed test cases.
