### Add Sectional Elements and Paragraphs 

Let’s begin to add some content to the body of your web page. Between your body tags: 

1) Add at least 2 divs. Remember that divs will later be used to style different parts of your web page differently (e.g., having different text font, color, or size, or a different background color for the web page content between the div tags).

2)  Add at least one header within a div tag. Play around with different header sizes (e.g., h1, h2 … h6).

3)  Add at least one paragraph within a div tag.

   Make some text bold to make it really stand out, drawing the reader’s attention.
   Emphasize some text with italics to draw attention or format a the title of a book, movie, or newspaper.
   Experiment with nesting tags—maybe you want to format a title within a bold heading.

4) Add some links to your “My Interests” page, linking to other web pages related to some of your interests.
5) Add images to your "My Interests" page. 
6) Create Lists
 
 Add an ordered list to your “My Interests” page. For example, you could rank your top five favorite foods, books, movies, etc.
 Add an unordered list. For example, list several places you would like to visit, jobs you would like to have, people you would like to meet, etc.

7) Make a Table
create a table, with at least two rows, including one header row. Use the table’s cells to organize text, images, or links for your web page.

### Style Your Web Page with CSS
1)  Use CSS to style at least two HTML elements (paragraphs, headings, images etc.)

2)  Add IDs or classes to at least two HTML elements.

3)  Use CSS to style your IDs or classes.
